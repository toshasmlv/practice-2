## 📑 Topics Covered

I have organized the tasks into three main categories. Click on a category to see the specific topics included:

<details>
<summary><b>1. Boolean Logic & Comparisons</b></summary>

* **Boolean Values:** Fundamentals of `True` and `False`.
* **Booleans as Comparison Results:** Using operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
* **Boolean Operators:** Combining conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. Conditional Statements</b></summary>

* **If Statement:** Basic decision making.
* **If Else:** Handling alternative execution paths.
* **If Elif Else:** Multi-way branching for complex logic.
* **Short Hand If Else:** Writing concise conditional expressions (Ternary operators).
* **Switch/If Elif Else:** Implementing selection logic and structural pattern matching.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. Iteration & Loops</b></summary>

* **While Loops:** Executing code based on a condition.
* **While Loop Break/Continue:** Controlling flow within while-statements.
* **For Loops:** Iterating over sequences (lists, tuples, ranges).
* **For Loop Break/Continue:** Skipping iterations or exiting for-loops prematurely.
</details>
